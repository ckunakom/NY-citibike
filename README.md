Let's pretend that I am a Data Analyst for New York Citi Bike Program. One of tasks is to generate regular reports that the PM can use to help with making decisions for improving the city or just to publicize the data to the public. The purpose of this repo is to build a dashboard to provide some story on the state of Citi Bike Progmram, specially two unexpected phenomenaðŸš²

The dashboard is built upon data compiled within the last 12 months from October 2019 to September 2020. Note that the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the state of New York was on March 1, 2020. I am personally interested in seeing how does the pandemic affects the Citi Bike usage.
